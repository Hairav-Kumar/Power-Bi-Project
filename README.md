# Power-Bi-Project
Project on E-commerce sales analysis! I utilized Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales, uncovering key trends and actionable insights. I delved into monthly profit trends, total profit, top customers, and product category performance. This project showcases my data visualization and analytical skills, demonstrating the power of data-driven decision-making in boosting online sales performance

Analysis Reason:
What are the sales trends over time?
Which products are the bestsellers?
Who are the top customers?
What is the average order value (AOV)?
What are the effects of promotions and discounts on sales?

Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.
Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data enable user driven parameters for visualizations.
Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart,, donut chart, slicers etc)
